# Java Practice Playground 👩‍💻☕️🎢

Welcome to my Java Practice Playground! This repository is dedicated to honing my Java programming skills and exploring various concepts, techniques, and projects related to Java development. Here, you'll find a collection of Java programs, exercises, and mini-projects that I've worked on to improve my understanding of Java and its ecosystem.

Whether it's experimenting with object-oriented programming, data structures and algorithms, GUI development, or diving into specific Java frameworks and libraries, this repository serves as my sandbox for continuous learning and growth as a Java developer. 

## Project List 📝📂

1. **University Management**
   - Description: A simplified console-based application for a university that manages different types of employees: professors, administrative staff, and support staff. This challenge allowed me to practice creating an inheritance hierarchy, implementing abstract methods, utilizing polymorphism, and encapsulating data within classes. It simulated a scenario where a software developer would design and implement an object-oriented solution for managing employees in a university setting. 
   - Features:
     - User input and output;
     - Mathematical calculations;
     - Conditional statements and loops;
     - OOP design.
    
2. **Agregating Registers**
   - Description: I was given an array of dates and an array of corresponding quantities. My task was to count the quantities for each date and display the results. It provided an opportunity to enhance my understanding of data manipulation and aggregation using collection classes.
   - Features:
     - Map;
     - Dates;
     - Arrays;
     - OOP design.
