# Personal Java Projects 👩‍💻☕️

Welcome to my personal Java projects repository! This repository contains a collection of Java projects that I have developed as part of my learning journey in Java programming. Each project focuses on different concepts, techniques, and functionalities, allowing me to explore various aspects of Java development.

## Project List 📝📂

1. **University Management**
   - Description: A simplified console-based application for a university that manages different types of employees: professors, administrative staff, and support staff. This challenge allowed me to practice creating an inheritance hierarchy, implementing abstract methods, utilizing polymorphism, and encapsulating data within classes. It simulated a scenario where a software developer would design and implement an object-oriented solution for managing employees in a university setting. 
   - Features:
     - User input and output;
     - Mathematical calculations;
     - Conditional statements and loops;
     - OOP design.
